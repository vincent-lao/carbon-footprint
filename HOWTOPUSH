Guide to using Datahub, but also pushing changes to Github:

Before you begin, click the green `Code` button, then `Open Github Desktop` in order to copy this repository to your computer locally. This only needs to be done once.

1. Each time before you start working, pull the changes with Github Desktop & click on the Binder button to download A COPY OF the most updated version of this repository to your Datahub.
2. Work on your notebook(s) on Datahub. The advantage to using Datahub as opposed to your computer is that 1) you don't need to work through Anaconda, and 2) you are working on the cloud when using Datahub, so that takes the stress of your computer.
3. When you want to push your changes, you need to first pull any changes download the notebook(s), and move it into your Github code folder, replacing the existing file there.
4. Commit and push any changes you have to Github using Github Desktop.
