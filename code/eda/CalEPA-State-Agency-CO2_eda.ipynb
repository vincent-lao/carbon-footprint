We see that data includes, for example, carbon emissions of a government building, government-owned vehicle, and even an entire fleet of government-owned vehicles. Given that there is nothing that contains a summary row, we believe that all the records capture granularity at the same level. Because the government agencies have the option to input their individual facilities, they are able to aggregate the sources at the agency level. \n",
